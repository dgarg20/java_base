There are a number of horizontal spacing macros for LaTeX:

\, inserts a \thinspace (equivalent to .16667em) in text mode, or \thinmuskip (equivalent to 3mu) in math mode;
\! inserts a negative \thinmuskip in math mode;
\> inserts \medmuskip (equivalent to 4.0mu plus 2.0mu minus 4.0mu) in math mode;
\; inserts \thickmuskip (equivalent to 5.0mu plus 5.0mu) in math mode;
\: is equivalent to \> (see above);
\enspace inserts a space of .5em in text or math mode;
\quad inserts a space of 1em in text or math mode;
\qquad inserts a space of 2em in text or math mode;
\kern <len> inserts a skip of <len> (may be negative) in text or math mode (a plain TeX skip);
\hskip <len> (similar to \kern);
\hspace{<len>} inserts a space of length <len> (may be negative) in math or text mode (a LaTeX \hskip);
\hphantom{<stuff>} inserts space of length equivalent to <stuff> in math or text mode. Should be \protected when used in fragile commands (like \caption and sectional headings);
\  inserts what is called a "control space" (in text or math mode);
  inserts an inter-word space in text mode (and is gobbled in math mode). Similarly for \space and { }.
~ inserts an "unbreakable" space (similar to an HTML &nbsp;) (in text or math mode);
\hfill inserts a so-called "rubber length" or stretch between elements (in text or math mode). Note that you may need to provide a type of anchor to fill from/to; see What is the difference between \hspace*{\fill} and \hfill?;
